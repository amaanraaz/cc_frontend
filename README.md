## Creating a design as given in assignment 

### Approach
- To create first a ui where a user can give input name and select data type using drop down 
- Required field making it a checkbox 
- delete button
- children components can be added when type is object


### And finally making it dynamic using redux toolkit for managing the state.

## Results can be seen in console when click submit
![]()


#### Authentication for each field is not completed yet due to time boundation.
#### child of child can be implemented also for object data type.
